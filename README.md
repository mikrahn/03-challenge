# 03-challenge


### This application is a password generator that prompt the user to input the length of the password and the character types that will be used in the password. Upon clicking the submit button, the application generates a randome password of the given lenght and using the given characters.

## Note: there is a known bug in this application that may appear when the user inputs the character types 'out of sequence' from the prompt. While the application generally works, I am still debugging this issue and will resubmit the assignment when I have it fixed.

### Here is a screenshot of the application UI:
